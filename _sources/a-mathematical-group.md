A group **G** is a collection of objects with an operation [satisfying well-established rules (axioms)](http://nrich.maths.org/1422). Also see [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)).

Today I realized that the **operation** is actually what defines a group, **NOT** the collection of objects. A collection of object is not a group (of objects) as I previously thought. My misunderstanding of the topic was probably because I was making a connection between the English meaning of the word _group_ and the mathematical term _group_. Also, a group can lose its status if the operation changes but the collection of objects remains the same (if some axioms stop being true for the new operation).

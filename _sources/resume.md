## Summary

A creative programmer and a heavy Linux user. Started tinkering with computers at age of 13. Since then, had a variety of experience in systems programming (C/C++), OS administration (Linux, Windows, macOS), scripting (Bash, Perl), and web (LAMP, Python & Django, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Node.js). For the past 6+ years my main interest lies in full-stack development of web applications, JavaScript, and everything JavaScript related ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Gjs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs), etc.).

I believe in the future of web interfaces to just about everything you can imagine! JavaScript is getting its grip on all major domains of human interaction, and I will be there to harness all the new possibilities. I am continuously looking into new ways to unleash the hidden potential of The Language That Can - of the language JavaScript!

Another area of interest is working with C/C++. Building applications involving computer vision, real-time video processing, 3D rendering, and system programming in general. IoT (Internet of Things) and hardware (embedded PCs, robotics, flying drones) are two domains where I participated in some very interesting projects.
 
## Experience

Over the past 10 years I worked in many companies, and on many projects. I know people who keep working at a single  company for 5-10 years. Fortunately (or unfortunately) in the past I had to switch projects many times. Some reasons for relatively short stays with a project:

- project reached feature-complete status; it became unnecessary to keep many developers
- finances were cut by the project leadership; some (or all) developers were disbanded
- life-changing events; re-location to a new city

Below is an accurate list of what I did so far in my career as a software engineer.

### Freelance: 2019 - now

Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and because I became a father, I switched to doing freelance work remotely. A few things I am engaged in now:

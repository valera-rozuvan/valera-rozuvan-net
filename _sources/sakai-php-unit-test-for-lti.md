[Dr. Chuck](http://www.dr-chuck.com/) has made available [on Github](https://github.com/csev/sakai-lti-test) a clone of the Sakai PHP Unit Test source code for LTI. Should be interesting to study it and compare to the code we have recently written for the [edX platform](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform).

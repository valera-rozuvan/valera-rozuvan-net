It seems that I have lost my ability to work. It is as though there is no more motivation that drives me forward.

Right now I am listening to [Glinka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Glinka) piano music. The musical pieces are simple and very Russian. [Rachmaninoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff) once quoted Tchaikovsky saying:

> Glinka is like an acorn from which all of Russian music has sprung up.

I need to get back to taking pleasure from simple things. Simple things like the short polka for children composed by Glinka (listen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW1WqnuBezU), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRC5Nu55n3g), or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMn3khIR3bA)). Listening to full-blown Rachmaninoff piano concertos has spoiled me to some extent. After I have heard them for more than a dozen of times, I started to feel like I have reached and glimpsed the top most level of perfection. As if I have reached the end. There is nothing more.

But this is wrong on so many levels. Life is infinitely more complex than the Rachmaninoff's Second Piano concerto. I must return to the basics. Simple, elegant, music pieces.

This philosophy of simplicity can then be transferred from music to the rest of my life.

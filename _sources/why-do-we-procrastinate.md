Welcome to the year 2014!

Today's topic is procrastination ^_^ Just came upon a [nice article](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303933104579306664120892036).

> We feel worry, anxiety, fear of failure. And we resort to just doing something that will make us feel better, like surfing the web.

An interesting perspective.

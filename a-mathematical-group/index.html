      <h1>A mathematical group</h1>
      <h5>Tue 28 Jan 2014 02:11:22 PM EET</h5>

<p>A group <strong>G</strong> is a collection of objects with an operation <a href="http://nrich.maths.org/1422">satisfying well-established rules (axioms)</a>. Also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">Wikipediaâ€™s definition</a>.</p>
<p>Today I realized that the <strong>operation</strong> is actually what defines a group, <strong>NOT</strong> the collection of objects. A collection of object is not a group (of objects) as I previously thought. My misunderstanding of the topic was probably because I was making a connection between the English meaning of the word <em>group</em> and the mathematical term <em>group</em>. Also, a group can lose its status if the operation changes but the collection of objects remains the same (if some axioms stop being true for the new operation).</p>

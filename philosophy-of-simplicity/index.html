      <h1>Philosophy of simplicity</h1>
      <h5>Fri 18 Apr 2014 08:54:44 AM EET</h5>

<p>It seems that I have lost my ability to work. It is as though there is no more motivation that drives me forward.</p>
<p>Right now I am listening to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Glinka">Glinka</a> piano music. The musical pieces are simple and very Russian. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff</a> once quoted Tchaikovsky saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Glinka is like an acorn from which all of Russian music has sprung up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need to get back to taking pleasure from simple things. Simple things like the short polka for children composed by Glinka (listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW1WqnuBezU">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRC5Nu55n3g">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMn3khIR3bA">here</a>). Listening to full-blown Rachmaninoff piano concertos has spoiled me to some extent. After I have heard them for more than a dozen of times, I started to feel like I have reached and glimpsed the top most level of perfection. As if I have reached the end. There is nothing more.</p>
<p>But this is wrong on so many levels. Life is infinitely more complex than the Rachmaninoffâ€™s Second Piano concerto. I must return to the basics. Simple, elegant, music pieces.</p>
<p>This philosophy of simplicity can then be transferred from music to the rest of my life.</p>

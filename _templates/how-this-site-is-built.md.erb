## How this site is built

This is a static site, generated from a bunch of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The generator used is the awesome [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). To orchestrate the build process, some [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) is thrown in the mix.

I wanted a very simple way to generate my static site. Using things like [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) seemed such an overkill. So I pieced some Bash and Ruby together. The end result is beautiful. You can see the [build script](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/valera-rozuvan-net/blob/main/build.sh) for yourself :)

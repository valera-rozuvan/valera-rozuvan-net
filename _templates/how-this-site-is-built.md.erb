## How this site is built

This is a static site, generated from a bunch of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The generator used is the awesome [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Some [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) is used to orchestrate the build process.

I wanted a very simple way to generate my static site, and using things like [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like an overkill to me. So I pieced some Bash and Ruby together, and it works beautifully. You can see the [code](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan) for yourself :)

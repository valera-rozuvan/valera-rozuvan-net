<h2 id="simplicity-in-life">Simplicity in life</h2>
<p>I have reached that stage of my life when I want to simplify things
as much as possible. To get done the really important stuff. Also,
having read way too much literature on the philosophy of Buddhism, some
of it is having an impact on the way I think and on the way I perceive
life around me. I start to think more before acting. I try to consider
the implications of my actions, and the effect that I want. Maybe it’s
just that I am finally maturing enough, getting out of that teenage
mindset :) I adore minimalism, and the way of the minimal path forward
through life. I hate distractions, and I try to minimize them as much as
I can. I focus, and hate it when I have to get out of my zone.</p>
<h2 id="on-finishing-projects">On finishing projects</h2>
<p>Another change I noticed is that I started caring deeply about
finishing stuff. Projects that I wanted to do for a LONG time, I
prioritize, and then do one by one. Obviously longer ones take a lot of
effort, energy, and resources to complete. But if I really believe in
the end result, I stick to it. Visualization helps. I must understand
what the future will bring, and have a clear vision of what I want to
achieve. Otherwise, I might abandon the project halfway through, like
with many things in the past. Having a feeling of accomplishment is a
key factor of what makes me feel happy, and what drives me forward.
Putting a check mark for having done a very complex task, is much more
rewarding.</p>
<h2 id="data-freedom-and-minimalism">Data, freedom, and minimalism</h2>
<p>Today I considered the question of digital data, and what to do with
it. In our age - it’s becoming a real problem to manage your own data.
There is just too much of it. Especially if you are online all the time,
and interact with other people online all the time. Photos, videos,
movies, books, songs, documents, application, projects, etc. etc. It
amounts to terabytes and terabytes of data. Now there are 3 things you
can do with data. You can collect the data, storing it on hard drives,
and lugging the large pile of disks with you wherever you go. You can
opt in for cloud storage, and pay each month a fee (which will be
ever-growing). Or you can simply not care - data comes, data goes.</p>
<p>With the last approach, you may choose to publish some of it in the
open. Stuff that you really care about, stuff that you want to have an
impact on others. Also, the most critical pieces of data you work with
at the moment, you have in your current PC/laptop. The idea is that you
minimize the impact of data on your life.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are two main things to consider regarding the
impact data can have on your life.</p>
<p>One, if you really do preserve terabytes and terabytes of data, you
get attached to it, to the point where you are afraid/reluctant to let
it go. With time, disks tend to break down, and cloud companies tend to
go out of business. Backing up and migrating terabytes of data is a
nightmare. Believe me. So if at some point you loose a good portion of
your data, it could turn into an emotional train wreck. Also, consider
all the money you will have spent up to that point on data upkeep. All
wasted. Not something I want to deal with.</p>
<p>Two, this is really a big problem for humanity. With the current
tools, it’s unmanageable. Data growth rates are beyond control of a
single individual. The future is bound to introduce some breakthrough
into the way we manage data. Until then, simply let it flow through your
devices. Don’t get attached to it. Attachment is bad. You care about the
experience, the memories. Not digital bits and bytes. Those are readily
available, and will be in the future. The freedom for data is a human
right, and there will be large conflicts in the future if someone will
try to handicap that freedom.</p>
